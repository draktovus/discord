## The Meaning of Freedom

Black freedom was about freedmen being able to do all the things that their former masters were able to do. It was about escaping the bondages of slavery and all of its injustices, separation of family, punishments of lashing, etc.

### Black Freedom
Political freedom was very much an important piece achieving freedom. For a democratic nation, denying a race or group the right to vote would mean that they were inferior. 

Churches and schools gave rise to another important part of freedom for blacks. Freedmen believed that education was an important avenue to fully attaining freedom. Reading and writing is important in many fields such as politics. Illiteracy was heavily exploited, as sharecropping contracts were especially harsh.

In 1865, Andrew Johnson ordered that nearly all land in federal hands must be given back to the former owners. Land reform was not achieved, and land was especially important to black freedmen. Land would give them economic independence and the power to not depend on anyone else but themselves, bearing the full fruit of their own labor.
